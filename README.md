This is streamlit app learning from Snowflake training DABW Badge 3: Data Application Builders Workshop.

The original app was build in SiS(streamlit in snowflake), then set up a strealmlit account and give it access to github account through deploing free 'Log in with GitHub'.

After all the sign-in and authorization, deply an app in streamlit (SniS) by github repository.

The error message of "Missing showflake connnection configuration" can be resolved by updating app settings "Secrets"
